Quantum Computing ExplainedQuantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles like superposition and entanglement to process information exponentially faster than classical computers. Qubits, unlike bits, can represent multiple states simultaneously.Applications include cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems. Companies like IBM and Google develop quantum processors. Challenges involve error correction and scalability.Hybrid quantum-classical systems bridge the gap. As technology matures, it could revolutionize fields like AI and materials science. Ethical implications, such as breaking encryption, raise concerns for security.
