Genetics and HeredityGenetics studies genes and heredity, with DNA as the blueprint. Gregor Mendel's pea plant experiments in the 1860s laid foundations for inheritance laws. The Human Genome Project mapped DNA in 2003.CRISPR enables precise gene editing, promising cures for diseases. Epigenetics shows environment influences gene expression. Applications span medicine, agriculture, and forensics.Ethical debates include designer babies and privacy. Advancements enhance understanding of evolution and health. Genetics continues to unlock life's mysteries.
