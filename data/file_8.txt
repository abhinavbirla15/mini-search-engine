Understanding Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across multiple computers securely. Invented for Bitcoin in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, it uses cryptography to ensure immutability and transparency.Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain supports smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum. Applications include supply chain tracking, voting systems, and digital identities. Consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake validate transactions.Scalability and energy consumption are ongoing concerns. Hybrid solutions and layer-2 protocols aim to improve efficiency. As adoption grows, blockchain could transform industries by enabling trustless, peer-to-peer interactions.
