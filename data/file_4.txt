Climate Change and Global WarmingClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, trapping heat in the atmosphere and causing global warming.Impacts include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to limit warming to well below 2°C. Solutions involve transitioning to renewable energy, reforestation, and sustainable agriculture.Countries like Sweden and Costa Rica lead in green initiatives. Individuals can contribute by reducing carbon footprints through recycling, using public transport, and supporting eco-friendly policies. Addressing climate change requires urgent, collective action to protect the planet for future generations.
