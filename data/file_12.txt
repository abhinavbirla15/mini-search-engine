Renewable Energy SourcesRenewable energy harnesses natural resources that replenish over time. Solar power uses photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity, with costs dropping dramatically. Wind turbines generate clean energy in windy regions, powering millions of homes.Hydropower from dams provides reliable baseload energy, while geothermal taps Earth's heat for heating and electricity. Biofuels from organic matter offer alternatives to fossil fuels.Transitioning to renewables reduces carbon emissions and creates jobs. Countries like Denmark and Germany lead in adoption. Challenges include intermittency and storage, addressed by batteries and smart grids. A sustainable future relies on embracing these technologies.
