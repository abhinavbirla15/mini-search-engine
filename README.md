# mini-search-engine
A mini search engine built from scratch using inverted indexing and BM25 ranking to retrieve and rank text documents based on relevance. The project demonstrates core information retrieval concepts such as tokenization, stopword removal, term frequency saturation, and document length normalization, similar to how modern search engines work.
