##Mini Search Engine (BM25-based)

This project is a mini search engine built from scratch to understand how real-world search systems work internally.
It focuses on applying DSA concepts like hashing, sets, inverted index, and ranking algorithms in a practical way.

The system allows users to search through a collection of documents and returns the most relevant results, ranked using BM25, the same ranking algorithm used by modern search engines.

#Features

Document loading from multiple .txt files

Text preprocessing and tokenization

Inverted index for fast search

OR-based document retrieval

BM25 ranking (term frequency saturation + length normalization)

Simple and clean Streamlit UI

Shows ranked search results with scores
