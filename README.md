# Mini Search Engine 🔍

This project is a **mini search engine built from scratch** using Python.  
It demonstrates how real-world search systems work internally, including **indexing, searching, and ranking documents**.

The goal of this project is to apply **DSA concepts in a practical way**, not just solve problems on paper.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads multiple `.txt` documents automatically
- Builds an **inverted index** for fast searching
- Supports **OR-based search**
- Ranks results using **BM25 (industry-standard ranking algorithm)**
- Handles:
  - Term Frequency Saturation
  - Document Length Normalization
- Simple and clean **Streamlit UI**
- Shows ranked documents with relevance scores
